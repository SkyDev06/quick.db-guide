### Discord.js

One of the most common usages for quick.db is with discord.js, below is an example of how that might look.
The following code is a messageCreate handler for tracking the messages of a user, separated by guild.

```js
const { Client } = require("discord.js");
const client = new Client();

const { QuickDB } = require("quick.db");
const db = new QuickDB();

client.on("messageCreate", async (message) => {
  const authorId = message.author.id;

  // Increment user's messageCount by 1
  await db.add(`messageCount_${authorId}`, 1);

  // Output user's messageCount. Typically, this would be output in a separate command.
  let messageCount = await db.get(`messageCount_${authorId}`);
  console.log(`User with the ID of ${authorId} has ${messageCount} messages.`);
});
```
